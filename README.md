# Virtual Pet Simulator

Hello! Welcome to the Virtual Pet Simulator by Star Coders. In this application you will be able to create pets by 
giving them a name. Pets will be assigned starting values for hunger, thirst and boredom. These starting values are 5.
As you play the game these values will increase with time, unless you feed, water or play with them. If you don't feed
water or play with your pet, and any of your pets' values reach 100, your pet will die.
